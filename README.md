# Project-3: Space Invaders, P2EGame with Smart Contracts

## User Story

- As a blockchain game developer,

- I want to create a P2E game using smart contracts,

- So that players can spend and earn tokens

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given that I want to create an interface that allows players to purchase and use tokens to play retro games,

- When a player wins the game, their token will be returned, but if they lose the contract keeps the token,

- Then smart contracts need to be created to allow players to purchase tokens and collect/dispurse tokens if the player wins or loses. 

## Project Title and Description

Our group created the ability to play a retro arcade game, Space Invaders, using Solidity smart contracts and game tokens on the ethereum blockchain. We have two Solidity smart contracts, gametoken and gameEscrow, that contain all the instructions for our front end interface. The front end and game graphics were created using Javascript, HTML and CSS. We used Ganache/Metamask for our test network as well as Remix IDE and Visual Studio for our code writing.

## Usage
